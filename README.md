# The-Station
Top-down 2D shooter created in SFML, a C++ library

Game created for Pałac Młodzieży's 2014 programming contest. 

Despite winning one of three prizes (There were no 1st, 2nd or 3rd places), 
the code quality is abysmal and I cringe really hard at so many things in there.
Fortunately that was CURRENT_YEAR - 2014 years ago and I've learned a lot since.
